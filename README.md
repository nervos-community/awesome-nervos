# Overview of Nervos

The decentralized economy is a natural evolution of the maturing Internet. Web 1.0 and 2.0 have revolutionized this planet and led to the meteoric rise of FAANG (Facebook/Apple/Amazon/Netfix/Google) in the West and BATX (Baidu/Alibaba/Tencent/Xiaomi) in the East.  

The Internet's expansion period is however, coming to an end. The growth ceiling we are approaching places tension on the relationship between platform and user. The positive-sum game that brought billions of people together has become zero-sum, with far-reaching effects on quality of life and innovation. 

The Internet's next transformation is being driven by a common desire for something better. Through permissionless protocols, the decentralized economy facilitates the future we aspire toward. With humble learnings from the pioneers before us, Nervos is a layered network built to support the decentralized economy. 

The Nervos Network separates into two layers: a verification layer (Layer 1) that serves as a trust root and asset custodian and a generation layer (Layer 2) for high-performance transactions and privacy protection. 

Layer 1 of the network comprises the Common Knowledge Base (CKB), which ensures the security of the trustless activities of the upper layers. Nervos’s engineers built the CKB from scratch to meet the needs of a layered architecture, with a design that focuses on state rather than computation. States are verified by global consensus and stored in a highly available peer-to-peer network.

The CKB provides a foundational layer that is used to define crypto-assets, digital identities and the trustless operations of upper layer protocols, state-channels and blockchains.

# Overview of CKB

Common Knowledge underpins all human interaction. People who share common knowledge only need to highlight new or distinguishing details to convey meaning and understanding. For example, it is common to make plans using only numerical dates, e.g., “let’s get together on the 15th.” This is possible because all participants already know what month it is, and have a common understanding of the system of the twelve months of the Gregorian calendar. This is a type of common knowledge base.

Nervos Common Knowledge Base (CKB), a permissionless public blockchain and base layer of the Nervos Network, functions in a fundamentally similar way.

* Secure, Sustainable, Decentralized
    * The consensus mechanism of the Common Knowledge Base is designed to prioritize open participation and provide a high level of security, with cryptoeconomics designed for long term sustainability. The CKB also serves as the data availability engine and the anchor of trust for the entire Nervos Network.
* Off-chain Computation and On-chain Verification
    * The Common Knowledge Base is a generalized verification engine with the assumption that computation happens off-chain. This offers a programming model that differs from smart contracts: verification scripts only need to uphold critical invariances, leaving state transition logic off-chain and flexible.
* True Asset Ownership
    * The state storage model of the Common Knowledge Base allows users to own assets directly, the same way that users directly own Bitcoin UTXOs. True asset ownership allows easier asset level customization and composability.
* Built for Developers and Layer 2 solutions
    * The Common Knowledge Base allows developers to program with most mainstream programming languages. With a low level virtual machine, libraries and crypto-primitives (such as signature algorithms or key functions) can be built and directly deployed on the VM - no hardfoks needed. Layer 2 solutions can take advantage of the security and low level VM for value storage and transaction verification.
