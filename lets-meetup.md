# **GENERAL INFO**

## GOALS

What are we trying to accomplish with Community Led Meetups?

1. Give the Nervos community the resources they need to organize successful meetups.
2. Encourage grassroots initiatives designed to grow the Nervos ecosystem.

Nervos is abbreviation by "Nerve of Society", we intended to create the infrastructure for decentralization economy, and meetups is one of the way we can know each other more, include developers, miners, holders. we hope everyone in Nervos community can benefit each other by any kind of ways.



## Topic Guidelines

There are several things to keep in mind when planning to host a community meetup. Firstly, these meetups are **not about speculating on the price of the tokens or general hype.** The core goal of hosting meetups is educating people about Nervos and the overarching narrative of decentralization economy.

- Who: Speakers
- How: Preparing a plan for promoting your event, and creating a [Budget](#Budget-Guide)



## Requesting Funds

Submitting a completed Community Meetup Form is equivalent to applying for a grant. Upon submitting this form, we will reach out to you through the associated email address that you used. The volume of submissions may be high, please allow up to a week of processing time before you attempt to follow up on a submission.

If your Community Meetup Form is accepted, the following are required:

1. Please send us an invoice through the email.
2. We strongly prefer the events to be free to attend, but if you are planning to charge at the door please disclose the amount you anticipate collecting in the "additional notes" section of the Grand Request Checklist. Please write the actual amount collected in the Feedback form.
3. After your event, please fill out and submit a Feedback form. Grantees who do not fill out this form will not be eligible for future funding.



## Hosting the Meetup

Once you have your meetup plan ready, speakers confirmed, the meetup place, and the event promoted, it's time for the execution.

### On the date of the event

- Send communications to all the essential parties early on in the day.
- It's also advisable to repeat the promotional messaging across all your channels the day of the event.
- Judging by the context, arriving at your venue a few hours beforehand in order to prepare and test everything is always an advisable thing to do. Remember to set time aside to ensure that the tech components (microphones, projectors, slide formats, cameras, livestream, etc. ) are all set-up and tested.
- If you are recording the event, set-up the camera location and all details associated with this process.
- Please make sure to introduce the program, the speakers, and state the key takeaways that the participants can expect from the event.
- Be welcoming and informative.
- Enjoy the event, meet people, and bond over the common interests we all share.
- At the end, it's always positive and respectful to mention and thank the sponsors, hosts, speakers and the attendees for making the meetup a success.



## Post-Event Process

As part of the requirements for getting funding approved, we require hosts to provide information about their event after-the-fact in a Feedback Form. This step exists in order for us to better understand the impact of these events and what we can do to help guide them to be better.

It is advisable for hosts to read through the full Feedback Form before the event begins so they can be prepared to answer the questions after the event concludes.

## **Marketing & Promotion Guide**

As soon as you have a chosen venue and secured date, make sure to register and promote the meetup as soon as possible so that others will be aware of it. Share the newly created meetup with your network as well as the MakerDAO Community.

There are several scheduling resources to choose from:

- [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) is a fantastic resource for promoting your meetup.
- [Eventbrite.com](https://www.eventbrite.com) has a free ticketing system that can be used for your meetup.



Crypto-Friendly Social Networks you may want to promote on:

- [Telegram](https://telegram.org/): Many public crypto meetup chat rooms, find the one right for you.
- [Wechat](https://web.wechat.com/): Many public crypto meetup chat rooms, find the one right for you.
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/): Sharing events with friends is a powerful tool to spread awareness.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/): Crypto twitter is far-reaching.
- [Craigslist](https://www.craigslist.org/): Posting in Groups & Events in the community section of your local craigslist site may attract more people to your event.



Local places to promote your event:

- Community Centers
- Coworking spaces
- Coffee shops



### Setting up your Event Page

In order to make people aware of your event, you will need to create an event page. An Event page has a few fundamental elements.

- The name of the Event
  - You can name your event anything you'd like. A good name can capture the theme, main topic, or general ethos of the talk.

- Description
  - This is a good place to go into detail about the purpose for your event, the agenda, who is speaking, who is a sponsor, etc…

- Additional details (such as "How to find us")
  - These will vary depending on the event. Simply put, add any additional information unique to your event that a potential attendee would find helpful.

- The time and location



### Some Pointers

- Always update your events page with any changes that might occur.
- We recommend that you reach out to attendees with reminders, updates, or teasers.
- In addition to the platform you are using for hosting the main event page, we recommend broad use of social media to promote your event and attract even more participants (see the MakerDAO socials above)—don't forget to link the URL from your main event page!
- Incentive members to bring their friends along. 
- Collaborate with other Meetup organizers and run events together. Groups must be complementary.

## Budget Guide

This is a guide on how to manage the financial side of hosting a meetup. Before you get going, we want community members to have a specific mentality when it comes to costs—It's important to always aim to achieve the most value for the money you are spending. If you are being given an honorarium to cover expenses for this event, it will be based on the Community Meetup Form you submit to us beforehand. Here are some guidelines for how you should budget for your event.

### The Space

The type of event you are hosting determines the requirements of the space. If possible, always try to get free space or one that might be offered as part of a secondary sponsorship. An example of this would be your local university giving you a conference room for free, as a part of a deal you might have negotiated with them. There are various strategies for how to best go about securing a space.

However, if the type of event requires equipment or a specific location it may be worthwhile to pay a rental fee.

### The Equipment

The first thing to ask yourself is what kind of equipment do you need? Most meetups involve some type of presentation. If this is the case for your event, please make sure to find out if the space has the equipment available to facilitate this (ie: a computer, projector, and screen). If the event is relatively small you can probably get through it without a microphone. Otherwise, it is usually always a good idea to have some form of voice amplification. If the venue has a microphone, they will likely have the speakers and system to use it with as well.

Ideally, you want to find a location that has all of these things included so you do not have to buy them yourself. If the venue does not have some of this equipment, the next possible step is to reach out to people attending your meetup. Posting in the event page, or reaching out to a few individuals you're familiar with might prompt someone to volunteer their own equipment to help out.

Beyond that, it is up to your own judgement to decide what you need to purchase. If you intend to do meetups at the same location in the future, then it might be a good idea to try to come to an agreement where the venue can hold on to any equipment you may have bought yourself. You can use this to negotiate cheaper rent prices, or simply to establish a good relationship with the venue.

### The Food & Beverages

The cost of food and beverages largely depends on the number of people at the event, how long the event will go on for, and the types of food and beverages. Since this may vary widely between different meetups, the best advice to give here is for individuals to use their best judgement.

The longer a meetup, the more reasonable it might be to provide some light food rather than snacks. Coffee or tea is generally always a good idea.

Don't forget to check if the venue allows for food and drinks!
